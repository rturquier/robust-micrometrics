# robust-micrometrics
This repository contains the code that we used for our report on "Why Do People Give? Testing Pure and Impure Altruism", by Mark Ottoni-Wilhelm, Lise Vesterlund and Huan Xie (2017). As part of the Advanced microeconometrics course at PSE, we reproduced the results of the original paper using robust methods.

- `describe.R` contains code used in part 2 of our project (descriptive statistics)
- `robust-regression.R` contains code for part 3
